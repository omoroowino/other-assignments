    <h2>Rotweilers are my <em>favorite</em>domestic dog breed</h1>
      <p><strong>Rotweilers</strong>They are known in German as<em>Rotweiler Metzgerhund</em>meaning Rotweil butcher's dogs as their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with meat to the market until mid 19th century.They are now used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs and as police dogs.</p>

      <p>It's temperaments are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Good natured</li>
        <li> Obedient</li>
        <li> Devoted</li>
        <li> Steady</li>
        <li> Self assured</li>
        <li> Fearless</li>
        <li> Alert</li>
        <li> Confident</li>
      </ul>

      <p> The Rotweiler is territorial and it is an extremely jealous animal. In its quest to protect its owner, it might inflict damage to other people. As a conclusion, it would be safe to say that this dog is not inherently destructive but they have a tendency to become dangerous beasts in the wrong hands.</p>
